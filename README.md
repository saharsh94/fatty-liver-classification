# Fatty Liver Classification Using Ultrasound Images

This project focuses on classifying the grade of fatty liver disease using ultrasound images. Due to the limited number of available images, we employed transfer learning by leveraging a pre-trained ResNet model on ImageNet to enhance the model's performance.

The implementation demonstrates the effectiveness of transfer learning in medical imaging applications with small datasets. The code is provided as a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) for easy reproducibility and adaptation.
